## Phase-field_PyCalphad-Tutorial
Dynamic Coupling of microstructure modeling using phase-field method with CALPHAD method using PyCalphad

## Introduction to Microstructure Thermodynamics.
### Taught as part of Texas A&M University MSEN 210 Course - Thermodynamics of Materials.

## Instructions...
#### 1. Check out the Jupyter notebook first...
#### 2. Then, review the powerpoint file...
#### 3. The phase-field code can be executed within the Jupyter environment. For that, you need gfortran or Intel Fortran pre-installed in your system.
#### 4. To run the phase-field code from terminal, just execute the "Makefile" by writting "make" in terminal. It will compile the code and create an executable file called "main". Then, type "./main" in terminal and wait for the phase-field code to finish. It will take 20-30 seconds.
#### 5. Microstructure result files are stored in the folder "microstructure" and are in "plt" format. These files can be visualuzed inside the jupyter notebook, using Tecplot (3rd party paid software), or Paraview (a free software).
