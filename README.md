## Phase-field_PyCalphad-Tutorial
Dynamic Coupling of microstructure modeling using phase-field method with CALPHAD method using PyCalphad

## Introduction to Microstructure Thermodynamics...
### Taught as part of Texas A&M University MSEN 210 Couse - Thermodynamics of Materials...

## Instructions...
#### 1. Check out the Jupyter notebook first...
#### 2. Then, review the powerpoint file...
#### 3. The phase-field code can be executed within the Jupyter environment. For that, you need gfortran or Intel Fortran pre-installed in your system.
#### 4. To run the phase-field code from terminal, just execute the "Makefile" by writting "make" in terminal. It will compile the code and create an executable file called "main". Then, type "./main" in terminal and wait for the phase-field code to finish. It will take 20-30 seconds.
