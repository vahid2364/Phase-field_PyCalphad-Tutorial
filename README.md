# **Phase-field_PyCalphad-Tutorial**
### **Dynamic Coupling of Microstructure Modeling with the Phase-field Method and CALPHAD Using PyCalphad**

---

## üöÄ **Overview**
Welcome to the **Phase-field_PyCalphad-Tutorial**, a comprehensive resource for exploring the dynamic coupling of microstructure evolution with thermodynamic modeling. This tutorial provides a practical approach to combining the **phase-field method** with the **PyCalphad library**, enabling predictive modeling of microstructural transformations in materials.

Developed as part of the *Texas A&M University MSEN 210 Course - Thermodynamics of Materials*, this tutorial serves as a stepping stone for students and researchers interested in computational materials science.

## üìö **Introduction to Microstructure Thermodynamics**
Understanding the thermodynamics of microstructures is a cornerstone of materials science. This tutorial bridges the theoretical foundations with practical implementation using cutting-edge computational tools:
- **Phase-field Method**: Simulates the evolution of microstructures during processes such as solidification, phase transformations, and grain growth.
- **PyCalphad Library**: A Python-based library for thermodynamic calculations based on the CALPHAD approach, seamlessly integrated with phase-field simulations.

This repository is ideal for students, educators, and researchers aiming to deepen their understanding of microstructure thermodynamics.

## üîß **Instructions**
Follow the steps below to get started with the tutorial:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Explore the Jupyter Notebook**
   - Start with the provided **Jupyter notebook**, which introduces the concepts and walks you through the dynamic coupling process.
   - The notebook includes visualizations and explanations to guide your understanding.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Review the PowerPoint Slides**
   - Supplement your learning with the provided **PowerPoint presentation**, which summarizes key concepts and methodologies.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the Phase-field Code**
   - The phase-field code is designed to run within the Jupyter notebook or from the terminal. Here‚Äôs how to execute it:
     - Ensure you have **gfortran** or **Intel Fortran** pre-installed on your system.
     - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code.
     - Execute the provided **Makefile**:
       ```bash
       make
       ```
     - This will compile the code and create an executable file called `main`.
     - Run the executable by typing:
       ```bash
       ./main
       ```
     - Wait 20-30 seconds for the simulation to complete.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Visualize Microstructure Results**
   - The resulting microstructure files are stored in the `microstructure` folder in `.plt` format.
   - You can visualize these results using:
     - **Jupyter Notebook**: Directly load and analyze the `.plt` files.
     - **Tecplot**: A third-party (paid) visualization software.
     - **ParaView**: A free and open-source visualization tool.
